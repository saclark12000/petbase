# PETBASE
## _Connecting pets to the information we need to share._

Website dedicated to keeping user friendly pet records.

Target audiences will be pet owners (current and future) and pet professionals (veterinarians, adoption agencies, and groomers). 

The general idea is for pet owners and adoption agencies to start a pet record that will follow a pet throughout the rest of it's life. The pet record could be shared with pet professionals and help find lost pets in the future.
